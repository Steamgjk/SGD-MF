Data compression is not considered in our case because of two main reasons: First, the data compression of large matrix can be time-consuming since it requires to traverse the whole data set for mutliple passes. Second, when confronted with dense matrix, data compression may be less effective, in other words, the matrix still remains too large after compression to be loaded into memory in advance. 

Since the whole matrix cannot be wholly loaded into memory, and each worker is unaware which block to pick in advance, thus it has to read the data from the disk after P and Q has received. Thus the disk I/O will incur additional overheads.
